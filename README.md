# Pavlov Party
This is a WIP gamemode consisting of multiple party minigames for Pavlov vr.
Inspired by the some of the most popular minecraft's minigames.

## List of minigames that will be worked on for v1.0
* One in the chamber - everyone spawns with a revolver, a melee weapon and only one bullet. When you kill someone, you receive a bullet. First to a number of kills win.
* Parkour run - You run fast, you can jump, and you have to complete a race with traps. First to the end wins.
* Spleef - The floor under you is falling, and people can melee what you are standing on.
* TNT run - The floor is falling under your weight, so you have to always move.
* Falling platforms - every 10 seconds, a random platform is selected. you have a small ammount of time to get to that platform or you will fall to your death.
* Assimilation mode - Everytime you get killed, you change teams. The game ends when everyone is on the same team. The points will be decided on the time each player stays on the team witht the lowest amount of players.
* Maze - A randomly generated maze. The first one out is the winner, and after the win, players will have 30 seconds to find the exit and get some points.

## To contribute to this project
If you want to contribute to this project, send me a message on discord (Skigma #3341).
It can be an idea for a new minigame to add, or to contribute by making your own gamemode (you can download this code to make your own minigame, but you can't upload your minigame as it's own map. If you do decide to make your own minigame, message me on discord first for the idea, and message me again if you need to test it online. you can post it on the workshop to test it online, but after the test, remove it from the workshop. I will add the minigame into my map if a known mapper has tried it and can say that there are close to no errors in the logic).
